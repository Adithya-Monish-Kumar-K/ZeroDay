## 🚩 Problem Statement

Small and medium-scale businesses struggle to find cost-effective road transportation solutions. The logistics industry faces critical inefficiencies:

- **Fragmented Networks:** No unified platform for coordinating multi-leg journeys (e.g., Lorry → Hub → Mini Truck)
- **Empty Return Trips:** Vehicles run empty on return routes, wasting fuel and capacity
- **Trust Deficits:** Lack of standardized verification for cargo handoffs between different transporters
- **Opacity:** Shippers have limited visibility into their shipment's journey across multiple carriers

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**ChainFreight** is a unified logistics aggregation platform that revolutionizes road transportation by:

1. **Intelligent Route Chaining:** Advanced algorithms stitch together multiple transporters to complete single shipment routes efficiently
2. **Trust Through Verification:** Mandatory photo-verified checkpoints at every handoff create a digital "Chain of Custody"
3. **Capacity Optimization:** AI matches shipments to trucks with available capacity and fills empty return trips
4. **Real-time Tracking:** End-to-end visibility for all stakeholders throughout the shipment lifecycle

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🧠 Multi-Leg Route Optimization
ChainFreight uses **Google OR-Tools** to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The system intelligently splits long-distance shipments into optimal segments handled by different vehicles based on:
- Vehicle capacity and type
- Geographic coverage zones
- Cost efficiency
- Delivery time constraints

**Example:** *Coimbatore → Salem (32-ft Lorry)* → *Salem → Chennai (Mini Tempo)*

### 2. 📸 Security-Verified Handoffs
Our proprietary "Chain of Custody" protocol requires drivers to upload **geotagged photo proof** at every critical point:
- **Pickup Verification:** Photo + GPS at origin
- **Transporter Handoffs:** Both drivers verify cargo transfer
- **Security Checkpoints:** Random verification points
- **Final Delivery:** Proof of delivery with recipient confirmation

### 3. 📉 Dynamic Pricing & Load Consolidation
The platform automatically:
- Calculates costs based on vehicle fuel efficiency, distance, and urgency
- Identifies "Return Trip" opportunities to offer discounted rates
- Consolidates multiple small loads into shared capacity
- Reduces empty miles for transporters while lowering costs for shippers

### 4. 🎯 Marketplace for Transporters
Open marketplace where transporters can:
- Browse available route legs matching their vehicle type
- Accept jobs that fit their existing routes
- Build reputation through verified deliveries
- Maximize vehicle utilization

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project follows a **Microservice-style Monorepo** architecture orchestrated via Docker for seamless deployment.

## 🛡️ Security & Design Decisions

### Row Level Security (RLS)

Supabase RLS policies enforce strict data access control:

- **Shippers** can only view/edit their own shipments
- **Transporters** can only update checkpoints for assigned route legs
- **Public Read** enabled for tracking URLs (with token)
- **Write Operations** require authentication and role verification

### The "Handoff Secret" Protocol

Critical cargo transfers require an additional security layer:

```javascript
// Handoff endpoint requires custom header
headers: {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer JWT_TOKEN',
  'x-handoff-secret': 'hackathon_secret_123'
}
```

This simulates a hardware key or QR code scan that both drivers must present during physical cargo transfer.

### Image Verification

All checkpoint photos are:
- Stored in encrypted Supabase buckets
- Geotagged with GPS coordinates
- Timestamped with server-side verification
- Linked to specific route legs for audit trails

---

## 🎯 Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Blockchain Integration:** Immutable audit trail for high-value cargo
- [ ] **ML Price Prediction:** Dynamic pricing based on market conditions
- [ ] **Mobile Apps:** Native iOS/Android apps for drivers
- [ ] **IoT Integration:** Real-time temperature/humidity monitoring
- [ ] **Carbon Tracking:** Calculate and offset CO2 emissions per shipment
- [ ] **Insurance API:** Automated cargo insurance quotes and claims
